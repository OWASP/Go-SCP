# Introduction

Go Language - Web Application Secure Coding Practices is a guide written for
anyone who is using the [Go Programming Language][1] and aims to use it for web
development.

This book is collaborative effort of [Checkmarx Security Research Team][2] and
it follows the
[OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide v2 (stable)][3] release.

The main goal of this book is to help developers avoid common mistakes while at
the same time, learning a new programming language through a
"hands-on approach".
This book provides a good level of detail on "how to do it securely" showing
what kind of security problems could arise during development.

## The Audience for this Book

The primary audience of the Go Secure Coding Practices Guide is developers,
particularly the ones with previous experience with other programming languages.

The book is also a great reference to those learning programming for the first
time, who have already finish the [Go tour][8].

## What You Will Learn

This book covers the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices Guide][3] topic-by-topic,
providing examples and recommendations using Go, to help developers avoid common
mistakes and pitfalls.

After reading this book, you'll be more confident you're developing secure Go
applications.

## About OWASP Secure Coding Practices

This book was adapted for Go Language from The [Secure Coding Practices Quick
Reference Guide][3], an [OWASP][4] - Open Web Application Security Project. It
is a "_technology agnostic set of general software security coding practices, in
a comprehensive checklist format, that can be integrated into the development
lifecycle_" ([source][3]).

[OWASP][4] itself is "_an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to
conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be
trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and
open to anyone interested in improving application security_" ([source][5]).
