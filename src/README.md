# Introduction

Go Language - Web Application Secure Coding Practices is a guide written for
anyone who is using the [Go Programming Language][1] and aims to use it for web
development.

This book is collaborative effort of [Checkmarx Security Research Team][2] and
it follows the
[OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide v2 (stable)][3] release.

The main goal of this book is to help developers avoid common mistakes while at
the same time, learning a new programming language through a
"hands-on approach".
This book provides a good level of detail on "how to do it securely" showing
what kind of security problems could arise during development.

## Why This Book

According to Stack Overflowâ€™s annual Developer Survey, Go has made the top 5
most Loved and Wanted programming languages list for the second year in a row.
With its surge in popularity, it is critical that applications developed in Go
are designed with security in mind.

Checkmarx Research Team helps educate developers, security teams, and the
industry overall about common coding errors, and brings awareness of
vulnerabilities that are often introduced during the software development
process.

## The Audience for this Book

The primary audience of the Go Secure Coding Practices Guide is developers,
particularly the ones with previous experience with other programming languages.

The book is also a great reference to those learning programming for the first
time, who have already finish the [Go tour][8].

## What You Will Learn

This book covers the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices Guide][3] topic-by-topic,
providing examples and recommendations using Go, to help developers avoid common
mistakes and pitfalls.

After reading this book, you'll be more confident you're developing secure Go
applications.



## About OWASP Secure Coding Practices

The [Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide][3] is an [OWASP][4] - Open
Web Application Security Project. It is a "_technology agnostic set of
general software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist
format, that can be integrated into the development lifecycle_" ([source][3]).

[OWASP][4] itself is "_an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to
conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be
trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and
open to anyone interested in improving application security_" ([source][5]).
