Validation and Storing authentication data
==========================================

Validation
----------

The key subject of this section is the authentication data storage, as more
often than desirable, user account databases are leaked on the Internet.
Of course that this is not guaranteed to happen, but in the case of such
an event, collateral damages can be avoided if authentication data,
especially passwords, are stored properly.

First, let's make it clear that "_all authentication controls should fail
securely_". You're recommended to read all other Authentication and Password
Management sections as they cover recommendations about
reporting back wrong authentication data and how to handle logging.

One other preliminary recommendation: for sequential authentication
implementations (like Google does nowadays), validation should happen only on
the completion of all data input, on a trusted system (e.g. the server).


Storing password securely: the theory
-------------------------------------

Now let's talk about storing passwords.

You don't really need to store passwords as they are provided by the users
(plaintext) but you'll need to validate on each authentication whether users
are providing the same token.

So, for security reasons, what you need is a "one way" function `H` so that for
every password `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is different from `p2`, `H(p1)` is also
different from `H(p2)`[^1].

Does this sound, or look, like Math?
Pay attention to this last requirement: `H` should be such a function that
there's no function `H⁻¹` so that `H⁻¹(H(p1))` is equal to `p1`. This means
that there's no way back to the original `p1`, unless you try all possible
values of `p`.

If `H` is one-way only, what's the real problem about account leakage?

Well, if you know all possible passwords, you can pre-compute their hashes and
then run a rainbow table attack.

Certainly you were already told that passwords are hard to manage from user's
point of view, and that users are not only able re-use passwords but they also
tend to use something easy to remember, which makes the universe really small.

How can we avoid this?

The point is: if two different users provide the same password `p1` we should
store a different hashed value.
It may sound impossible but the answer is `salt`: a pseudo-random **unique per
user password** value which is appended to `p1` so that the resulting hash is
computed as follows: `H(p1 + salt)`.

So each entry on passwords store should keep the resulting hash and the `salt`
itself in plaintext: `salt` is not required to remain private.

Last recommendations.
* Avoid using deprecated hashing algorithms (e.g. SHA-1, MD5, etc)
* Read the [Pseudo-Random Generators section][1].

The following code-sample shows a basic example of how this works:

```go
package main

import (
    "crypto/rand"
    "crypto/sha256"
    "database/sql"
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

const saltSize = 32

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    email := []byte("john.doe@somedomain.com")
    password := []byte("47;u5:B(95m72;Xq")

    // create random word
    salt := make([]byte, saltSize)
    _, err := rand.Read(salt)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // let's create SHA256(password+salt)
    hash := sha256.New()
    hash.Write(password)
    hash.Write(salt)

    // this is here just for demo purposes
    //
    // fmt.Printf("email   : %s\n", string(email))
    // fmt.Printf("password: %s\n", string(password))
    // fmt.Printf("salt    : %x\n", salt)
    // fmt.Printf("hash    : %x\n", hash.Sum(nil))

    // you're supposed to have a database connection
    stmt, err := db.PrepareContext(ctx, "INSERT INTO accounts SET hash=?, salt=?, email=?")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    result, err := stmt.ExecContext(ctx, email, h, salt)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

}
```

However, this approach has several flaws and should not be used. It is given
here only to illustrate the theory with a practical example. The next section
explains how to correctly salt passwords in real life.


Storing password securely: the practice
---------------------------------------

One of the most important adage in cryptography is: **never roll your own
crypto**. By doing so, one can put at risk the entire application. It is a
sensitive and complex topic. Hopefully, cryptography provides tools and
standards reviewed and approved by experts. It is therefore important to use
them instead of trying to re-invent the wheel.

In the case of password storage, the hashing algorithms recommended by
[OWASP][2] are [`bcrypt`][2], [`PDKDF2`][3], [`Argon2`][4] and [`scrypt`][5].
Those take care of hashing and salting passwords in a robust way. Go authors
provide an extended package for cryptography, that is not part of the standard
library. It provides robust implementations for most of the aforementioned
algorithms. It can be downloaded using  `go get`:

```
go get golang.org/x/crypto
```

The following example shows how to use bcrypt, which should be good enough for
most of the situations. The advantage of bcrypt is that it is simpler to use and
is therefore less error-prone.

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "context"
    "fmt"

    "golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    email := []byte("john.doe@somedomain.com")
    password := []byte("47;u5:B(95m72;Xq")

    // Hash the password with bcrypt
    hashedPassword, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword(password, bcrypt.DefaultCost)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // this is here just for demo purposes
    //
    // fmt.Printf("email          : %s\n", string(email))
    // fmt.Printf("password       : %s\n", string(password))
    // fmt.Printf("hashed password: %x\n", hashedPassword)

    // you're supposed to have a database connection
    stmt, err := db.PrepareContext(ctx, "INSERT INTO accounts SET hash=?, email=?")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    result, err := stmt.ExecContext(ctx, hashedPassword, email)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

Bcrypt also provides a simple and secure way to compare a plaintext password
with an already hashed password:

 ```go
 ctx := context.Background()

 // credentials to validate
 email := []byte("john.doe@somedomain.com")
 password := []byte("47;u5:B(95m72;Xq")

// fetch the hashed password corresponding to the provided email
record := db.QueryRowContext(ctx, "SELECT hash FROM accounts WHERE email = ? LIMIT 1", email)

var expectedPassword string
if err := record.Scan(&expectedPassword); err != nil {
    // user does not exist
}

if bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword(password, []byte(expectedPassword)) != nil {
    // passwords do not match
}
 ```
