Pseudo-Random Generators
========================

In OWASP Secure Coding Practices you'll find what seems to be a really complex
guideline: "_All random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs, and random
strings should be generated using the cryptographic moduleâ€™s approved random
number generator when these random values are intended to be un-guessable_", so
let's talk about "random numbers".

Cryptography relies on some randomness, but for the sake of correctness what
most programming languages provide out-of-the-box is a **pseudo**-random number
generator: [Go's math/rand][1] is not an exception.

You should carefully read the documentation when it states that "_Top-level
functions, such as Float64 and Int, use a default shared Source that produces a
**deterministic sequence** of values each time a program is run._" ([source][2])

What exactly does it mean?
Let's see

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math/rand"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Random Number: ", rand.Intn(1984))
}
```

Running this program several times will lead exactly to the same
number/sequence, but why?

```bash
$ for i in {1..5}; do go run rand.go; done
Random Number:  1825
Random Number:  1825
Random Number:  1825
Random Number:  1825
Random Number:  1825
```

Because [Go's math/rand][1] is just a **pseudo**-random number generator like
many others and they use a source.
We could "fix" this example quite easily by using the [math/rand Seed function][3]
getting the expected five different values for each program execution, but
because we're on Cryptographic Practices section we should follow to
[Go's crypto/rand package][4].

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math/big"
import "crypto/rand"

func main() {
    rand, err := rand.Int(rand.Reader, big.NewInt(1984))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Random Number: %d\n", rand)
}
```

You may notice that running [crypto/rand][4] is slower than [math/rand][1] but
this is expected: not always is the fastest algorithm the safest.

```bash
$ for i in {1..5}; do go run rand-safe.go; done
Random Number: 277
Random Number: 1572
Random Number: 1793
Random Number: 1328
Random Number: 1378
```

If you're curious about how this can be exploited just think what happens if
your application creates a default password on user signup, by computing the
hash of a pseudo-random number generated with [Go's math/rand][1] as shown in
the first example?

Yes, you guessed it, you would be able to predict the user's password!
