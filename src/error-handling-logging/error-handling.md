Error Handling
==============

In Go, there is a built-in `error` type. The different values of `error` type,
indicate an abnormal state. Usually in Go if the `error` value is not nil
then an error has occurred, and must be dealt with, in order to allow the
application to recover from said state without crashing.

A simple example taken from the Go blog follows:

```go
if err != nil {
    // handle the error
}
```

Not only can the built-in errors be used, we can also specify our own error
types. This can be achieved by using the `errors.New` function.
Example:

```go
{...}
if f < 0 {
    return 0, errors.New("math: square root of negative number")
}
//If an error has occurred print it
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
}
{...}
```

Just in case we need to format the string containing the invalid argument to see
what caused the error, the `Errorf` function in the `fmt` package allows us
to do this.

```go
{...}
if f < 0 {
    return 0, fmt.Errorf("math: square root of negative number %g", f)
}
{...}
```

When dealing with error logs, the developers should ensure no sensitive
information is disclosed in the error responses, as well as guarantee that no
error handlers leak information (e.g. debugging, or stack trace information).

In Go there are additional error handling functions, these functions are
`panic`, `recover` and `defer`. When an application state is `panic` it's
normal execution is interrupted, any `defer` statements are executed, and
then the function returns to it's caller. `recover` is usually used inside
`defer` statements and allow the application to regain control over a
_panicking_ routine, and return to normal execution.
The following snippet, based on the Go documentation explains the execution
flow:

```go
func main () {
    start()
    fmt.Println("Returned normally from start().")
}

func start () {
    defer func () {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered in start()")
        }
    }()
    fmt.Println("Called start()")
    part2(0)
    fmt.Println("Returned normally from part2().")
}

func part2 (i int) {
    if i > 0 {
        fmt.Println("Panicking in part2()!")
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("%v", i))
    }
    defer fmt.Println("Defer in part2()")
    fmt.Println("Executing part2()")
    part2(i + 1)
}
```

Output:

```
Called start()
Executing part2()
Panicking in part2()!
Defer in part2()
Recovered in start()
Returned normally from start().
```

By examining the output we can see how Go can handle `panic` situations and
recover from them, allowing the application to resume its normal state. These
functions allow for a graceful recovery from an otherwise unrecoverable
failure.

It's worth noting that `defer` usages also include _Mutex Unlocking_, or
loading content after the surrounding function has executed (e.g. footer).

In the `log` package there is also a `log.Fatal`. Fatal level is effectively
logging the message, then calling `os.Exit(1)`.
Which means:

* Defer statements will not be executed.
* Buffers will not be flushed.
* Temporary files and directories are not removed.

Considering all the previously mentioned points, we can see how `log.Fatal`
differs from `Panic` and why it should be used carefully.
Some examples of the possible usage of `log.Fatal` are:

* Set up logging and check whether we have a sane environment and parameters.
  If we don't, then there's no need to execute our main().
* An error that should never occur and that we know that it's unrecoverable.
* If a non-interactive process encounters an error and cannot complete, there
  is no way to notify the user about this error. It's best to stop the
  execution before additional problems can emerge from this failure.

An example of initialization failure to illustrate:

```go
func init(i int) {
    ...
    //This is just to deliberately crash the function.
    if i < 2 {
        fmt.Printf("Var %d - initialized\n", i)
    } else {
        //This was never supposed to happen, so we'll terminate our program.
        log.Fatal("Init failure - Terminating.")
    }
}

func main() {
    i := 1
    for i < 3 {
        init(i)
        i++
    }
    fmt.Println("Initialized all variables successfully")
```

It's important to assure that in case of an error associated with the security
controls it's access is denied by default.
