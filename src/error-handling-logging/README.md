Error Handling and Logging
==========================

Error handling and logging are an essential part of application and
infrastructure protection. When Error Handling is mentioned, it is referring to
the capture of any errors in our application logic that may cause the system to
crash unless handled correctly. On the other hand, Logging details all the
operations and requests that occurred on our system. Logging not only allows the
identification of all operations that have occurred, but it also helps determine
what actions need to be taken to protect the system. Since attackers sometime
attempt to remove all traces of their action by deleting logs, it's critical
that logs are centralized.
