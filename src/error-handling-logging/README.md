Error Handling and Logging
==========================

Error handling and logging are essential parts of application and infrastructure
protection. When Error Handling is mentioned, it is referring to the capture of
any errors in our application logic that may cause the system to crash, unless
handled correctly. On the other hand, logging highlights all the operations and
requests that occurred on our system. Logging not only allows the identification
of all operations that have occurred, but it also helps determine what actions
need to be taken to protect the system. Since attackers often attempt to
remove all traces of their action by deleting logs, it's critical that logs are
centralized.
